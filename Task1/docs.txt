This file contains the documentation for the code for Task1

1. The sum of two numbers adds two numbers using the '+' operator.

2. Odd or Even is checked by checking if the remainder after division by 2 is 0.

3. The factorial of a number is calculated using a loop and multiplying the numbers.

4. The fibonacci function creates a list with initial elements [0, 1] and then in loop adds
   the previous two elements and appends them at end of list

5. Reversing a string uses split operation ([::-1])

6. Palindrome uses similar approach for reversing string as previous question and then
   checks if it is equal to the original string

7. The leap year function checks the following:
	1. Checks if year is divisible by 4
	2. If yes check if not divisible by 100
	3. If not the leap year or non leap year
	4. Then checks if not divisible by 4 then check if divisible by 400
	   if yes then leap year else non leap year

8. To check if number is armstrong number first number is converted to string for counting
   number of digits and then each digit is raised to number of digits and sum is stored and
   then it is compared with original number.

9. The encryption program uses simple encryption and decryption method by taking
   a shift amount and then shifts each character by that amount in alphabetic order
   and to decrypt it again subtract the same shift amount
